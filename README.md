# Elixir for a better world!

![Make it better!](./media/love-blue.svg)

A more-or-less-curated list of [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) OSS projects or private companies aimed for the good of the world ðŸ§¡

(inspired by [awesome-elixir](https://github.com/h4cc/awesome-elixir/))

## Why?

Because I need positive vibes. Because I need to know there's something worth fighting for.

Because the [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) community is so kind, diverse and inclusive I know there must be a lot of projects expressing this.

Because maybe you're looking for a new job, why not joining the good guys?

## How?

Started by a small Twitter "[survey](https://twitter.com/zoten_deschain/status/1490436544221614081)", directly to this repo.
First help and contributions by the awesome [Elixir Forum](https://elixirforum.com/t/elixir-for-a-better-world/45910).
Categories are my own choice of the moment and are subject to change (and feedback!)

However, this is my best in understanding community's feedbacks
