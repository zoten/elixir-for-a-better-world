# Contributing to Elixir for a Better World

Welcome, and thank you! ðŸ§¡

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing, absolutely inspired by [Awesome Elixir](https://github.com/h4cc/awesome-elixir/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).
I like to think we all have some common sense, so those points acts as suggestions. You can tweak them if it is the case, just be kind!

## How Can I Contribute?

### Submitting Pull Requests

Do you know any Elixir based project aimed for the good of the world that isn't listed here? Please submit a pull request, we will be happy to receive it!
The general idea is:

 * Projects aimed to make this a better world in good ways:
   * sustainability
   * social change
   * (possibly free or low cost) learning
   * charity
   * ...you call it!
 * There are "borderline" projects/companies that may enter the list despite non entering one of the above categories, e.g.
   * great and accreditated culture / diversity
   * great contributions to the world


## Contribution Guidelines

* Create a pull request (not an issue)
* Please search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate
* For packages/OSS projects or platforms use a link to the source repository like GitHub/Gitlab/Bitbucket and a link to the splash page, if any
* Please make an individual pull request for each suggestion
* Suggest the category you see the fit
* Keep descriptions short and simple (possibly use their own, without self-celebrating parts, e.g. "the world's greatest `X`")
* Check your spelling and grammar. And mine, if possible
* New categories, or improvements to the existing categorisation are welcome!
* Category names have to be alphabetically sorted
* Entry names inside Categories have to be alphabetically sorted from a-z
* Use [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org) to ensure consistent line-endings, tabs/spaces, etc. or make sure manually that your Editor is configured 'the right way' (see `.editorconfig` for details)
* Be kind!

Thank you for your contribution, suggestions and love for this strange world! ðŸ§¡
